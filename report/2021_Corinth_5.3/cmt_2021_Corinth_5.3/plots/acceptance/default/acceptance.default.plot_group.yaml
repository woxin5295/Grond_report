    Acceptance rate (black line) within a moving window of 200 iterations.


    A model is considered accepted, if it is accepted in at least one chain. The

    popularity of accepted models is shown as blue dots. Popularity is defined as

    the percentage of chains accepting the model (100% meaning acceptance in all

    chains). A moving average of the popularities is shown as blue line (same

    averaging interval as for the acceptance rate). Different background colors

    represent different sampler phases.

    Model acceptance per bootstrap chain averaged over 35 models (background color,

    low to high acceptance as light to dark colors).


    Black dots mark the base chains used when sampling new models (directed sampler

    phases only).
