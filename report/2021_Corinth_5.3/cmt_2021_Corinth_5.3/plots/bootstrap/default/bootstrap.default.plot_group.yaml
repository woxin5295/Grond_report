title: Bootstrap Misfit
description: '

  Sorted misfit (descending) of single bootstrap chains.


  For each bootstrap configuration, all models are sorted according to their

  misfit value (red lines) and their global misfit value (black line). (They are

  sorted individually for each line). The best model of every bootstrap

  configuration (right end model of red lines) is marked as a cross in the global

  misfit configuration. The horizontal black lines indicate mean and +- standard

  deviation of the y-axis values of these crosses.


  If the bootstrap configurations converge to the same region in model-space, all

  crosses should be close to the right end of the plot. If this is not the case,

  some bootstrap configurations have converged to very different places in

  model-space. This would indicate that there might be inconsistencies in the

  observations (maybe due to faulty or noisy or misoriented data). Also the shape

  of the curve in general can give information. A well-behaved optimisation run

  has approximately linear functions in this plot. Only at the end they should

  have a higher downward gradient. This would be the place where the objective

  functions of the bootstrap start to disagree.
