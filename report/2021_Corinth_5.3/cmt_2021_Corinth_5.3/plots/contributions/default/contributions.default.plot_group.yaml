description: '

  Contributions of the targets to the total misfit.


  The relative contribution that each single target has in the global misfit

  result is plotted relative and unscales as a function of global misfit

  (descending).


  The target contribution is shown in color-filled curves with the bottom curve

  on the bottom and the best-fit target on top. This plot can be used to analyse

  the balance of targets in the optimisations. For ideal configurations, the

  target contributions are of similar size. If the contribution of a single

  target is much larger than those of all others, the weighting should be

  modified.
