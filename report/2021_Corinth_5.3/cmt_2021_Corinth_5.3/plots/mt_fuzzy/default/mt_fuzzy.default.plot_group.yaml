description: '

  A fuzzy moment tensor, illustrating the solution''s uncertainty.


  The P wave radiation pattern strength of every ensemble solution is stacked for

  all ray spokes. The projection shows the stacked radiation pattern. If the

  variability of the ensemble solutions is small, the fuzzy plot has clearly

  separated black and white fields, consistent with the nodal lines of the global

  best solution (indicated in red).
